# mcp_online_food_ordering
I designed and implemented an online food ordering system. This system includes features such as user registration, menu browsing, order placement, and secure payment processing. The interface is designed to be intuitive, with easy navigation through various food categories and detailed item descriptions. The system also incorporates real-time order tracking, allowing users to monitor the status of their orders from preparation to delivery. Utilizing technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend integration, this project demonstrates my ability to create functional, user-friendly web applications tailored to enhance the customer experience in the food service industry.
